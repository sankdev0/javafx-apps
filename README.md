# com.sankdev.portfolio 
Demo Java FX project created as a basis for a student work portfolio project (a university project).
The aim of the project is to create a JavaFX modular application to store a student portfolio. Additionally, both demonstrate and employ best practices as to the following requirements: <br><br>
Use OOP (a hierarchy of classes, encapsulation, polymorphism) <br>
Programming to interfaces<br>
In-program data storage in collections, persistence data storage via serialization<br>
Develop add, remove, edit, search, sort methods for collections<br>
Develop GUI. Item edit in a separate modal window. Data presentation in a grid/table view. No database used, persistence is via serialization.<br>
Use modules (JPMS).<br><br>

Technologies used.<br>
JDK 15.0.1 and JavaFX 15.0.1 FXML layouts<br>
CSS for styling the GUI<br>
