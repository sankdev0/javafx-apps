# javafx-demo-one
Demo Java FX project created to serve as a basis for a student work portfolio project (a university project).
The aim of the project is to create an application to store a student portfolio. Additionally, both demonstrate and employ best practices as to the following requirements:

Use OOP (a hierarchy of classes, encapsulation, polymorphism)
Programming to interfaces
In-program data storage in collections, persistence data storage via serialization
Develop add, remove, edit, search, sort methods for collections
Develop GUI. Item edit in a separate modal window. Data presentation in a grid/table view. No database used, persistence is via serialization.

Technologies used.
JDK 15.0.1 and JavaFX 15.0.1 FXML layouts
